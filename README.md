## 📌 Project Overview

This project presents a detailed analysis of heart disease data using **Tableau**. The analysis takes into account multiple clinical parameters such as:

- Age  
- Sex  
- Resting ECG readings  
- Chest pain types  
- Cholesterol levels  
- Blood pressure  
- Heart rate  
- Blood sugar levels  

The goal was to uncover trends and high-risk indicators through interactive and intuitive visualizations as part of our second-year engineering coursework.

## 🧠 Key Insights

- 🧓 **Highest risk age group**: Individuals around **age 58** showed the highest likelihood of cardiac arrest.
- 🧬 **Cholesterol and age**: High cholesterol readings were common between ages **54–60**.
- ♀️♂️ **Gender differences**: Males generally exhibited **higher resting blood pressure** and **maximum heart rate** than females.
- 💥 **Chest pain correlation**: Higher intensity chest pain was strongly associated with heart disease presence.
- 💓 **ECG readings**: Notable ECG irregularities were found mostly in patients between **50–60 years** old.
